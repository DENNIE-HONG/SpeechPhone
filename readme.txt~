Overview
Crowdpp has two parts of code: the code in the packages "de.fau.cs.jstk.*" are borrowed from the "jstk" package developed by the Speech Group at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, which is primarily used for MFCC feature extraction; the code in the packages "edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.*" is developped by Chenren Xu and Sugang Li:
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.audio" package includes audio recording, data convertion (from byte to float), feature extraction (MFCC and pitch), cross calibration (see "Cross calibration"), and speaker counting algorithm.
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.db" package includes the functions related with sqLite databased operation.
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.sensor" package includes the location tracking service.
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.service" package includes the audio recording and speaker counting services.
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.ui" package includes the Android fragments as the UI interface
"edu.rutgers.winlab.crowdpp.util" package includes the constants and utility functions (time, math, distance, file process)
